<p>
weapons are the primary method of dealing damage in Apex Legends. In Battle Royale, Legends drop into the arena without any weapon equipped, and must find them from any suitable loot source upon landing. In Arenas Icon.svg Arenas, any weapon that is not a Supply Drop Weapon can be purchased before the round starts. Regardless of the game mode, up to two firearms can be carried.

A weapon's effectiveness and fire power can be enhanced through attachments that can help stabilize the weapon, increase its mag size, change its iron sights, or unlock new fire modes.

All weapons are split in seven categories: assault rifles, sub machine guns, light machine guns, marksman weapons, snipers, shotguns, and pistols.
